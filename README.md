# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a visualizer for various sorting algorithms, implemented using Python and Pygame. The visualizer allows you to see how different sorting algorithms sort a list of numbers step-by-step. It is an educational tool designed to help you understand the inner workings of these algorithms.

## Features

- **Visualize Sorting Algorithms**:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
- **User Controls**:
  - Reset and generate a new random list
  - Start/stop the sorting process
  - Choose between ascending and descending order
  - Switch between different sorting algorithms

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Controls
- R: Reset the list and generate a new random list
- SPACE: Start/stop sorting
- A: Set sorting order to ascending
- D: Set sorting order to descending
- I: Select Insertion Sort
- B: Select Bubble Sort
- S: Select Selection Sort
- Q: Select Quick Sort
- M: Select Merge Sort
